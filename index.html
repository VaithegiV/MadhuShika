            <p>The sleepless nights, the conversations we had, the time we spent together‚Äîthe way we forgot the world around us. It was just us in that small world. The way you speak, the way your eyes move, and your hands‚Äîstill magical</p>

            <p>You called me that rainy evening for ice cream. It was new for me; I didn‚Äôt know how to react or what to say, but you made me feel comfortable. I was nervous, and I dropped my ice cream, so you gave me yours.</p>

            <p>I knew you were upset about something and came to ask about it. You didn‚Äôt tell me why, but I felt like I needed to console you, to be there for you, and to make you happy. So I ran and picked yellow flowers for you, hoping to brighten your day. You kept them like a treasure.</p>

            <p>My mind knows that I can't get emotionally involved again and risk getting hurt, but my heart longs for love‚Äîit longs for you. You left the hostel for just two days, but it felt like two years to me. I‚Äôve never missed someone so much before, but I did, because it was YOU!</p>

            <p>I was not a perfect person, and I'm still not perfect. But you made me somewhat better. You cured the wounds... you cured the broken heart that you didn't break. You made me feel like a human who is worthy of being loved.</p>

          <small>Unexpected Soulmate</small> 
          <p> I never ever dreamt that there would be a person in my life who gave me butterflies, made me smile when being alone, made me do my best for them, made me write poems, made me travel 1200kms just to see their face. Even after a lot of hurting, I can't let go. You made me feel like life is worth living, made me forget about everything around you. It happened because of you, because you're the person who made me feel all these things.

      <small> The tension is real</small> 
      <p>I always say that without lust, love is boring. I don't know what I meant, but lust really takes this to another level of intimacy. The trust you had in me - I realized how much a person can love someone to trust them to the core with their most secret feelings.</p>

      <p>The day you vacate the hostel doesn't even feel real. Every day I need you near me. I want to hear your voice, want to feel your presence beside me when I'm going to sleep. The memories of you help me go through the lowest phase of my life.</p>

      <p>I won't say that I haven't made you cry, but seeing you cry is my weakness. I can't handle it. I've used harsh words, yet you still choose to be with me. I haven't fulfilled some of your expectations, but you still come back to me every time I leave. </p>

      <h2>Reality Hits</h2>
      <small>The Slow Fade of Us</small> 
      <p>Days go by, months pass, a year finishes, and it becomes hard for both of us. The long distance is hell. Everything started to change little by little. You don't want this, then I don't want this, but neither of us can let go. Conversations become short. Sleepless nights turn into "I'm going to sleep." Talking for two to three hours becomes "I have a headache." Priorities change. Careers occupy our minds. Still, the heart wants what we had and what we were. At the end, it should be us against the problem, but it became you vs me.

      <h2>Oppsites</h2>
      <small>Lost in Translation</small> 
      <p> 
        I wanted you to change for me, but you loved me the way you are. This is what broke our bond. Our expectations didn‚Äôt match, leading to countless arguments and misunderstandings. We experienced many ups and downs and often thought about how toxic we had become. But the love we shared during the first ten months wouldn't let us be apart.

      <h2>Sad but True</h2>
      <small>Magnetic Pull</small> 
      <p>I know that whatever happens, we will still have that attraction for each other no matter what, until someone replaces the other. Until then, it‚Äôs always you for me, and me for you.
      </p> 
      <span class="arrow"></span>
  </div>

<div class="lastpart">
  Lastly, this isn't a complete picture of what we had, just some significant turning points. So, if I expected too much, it‚Äôs my fault. But if I wanted our feelings to be mutual, it not only mu fault but ours. But I'll always love and care about you, but the excitement I once felt when receiving your messages and calls is gone. The blushing, smiling, and feelings like you were mine alone and no one have the rights to share my love are no longer there. We're individuals, knowingly or unknowingly, I don‚Äôt want to control your feelings. But I still fucking love you and cherish this beautiful chapter of my life. Some things are beautiful but incomplete, and I guess we fit into that category. And here we are heart full of love and mind full of confusion. We know there's no future for us, but we can't stop falling for each other. Some people meet the right person at the right time, some meet the wrong people, but we're the epitome of right people, wrong time. Maybe in the next life (if there is one), without socity norms and complexities, I hope we can meet with love and life.
